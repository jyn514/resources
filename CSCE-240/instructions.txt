Do your programming in the 'source/nelsonjoshua_hw0x' for
programming assignment number x. That is, the 'x' should be replaced
by the actual number of the homework assignment.

Run 'make test' or simply 'make' to test your programs.
If this works, you should have the appropriate output files in 'testing'.
