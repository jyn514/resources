### CSCE-240/Utilities
These programs were made by Professor
[Duncan Buell](https://cse.sc.edu/duncanbuell), who
teaches an introductory C++ course at the University of
South Carolina. He also teaches Introduction to Cryptography,
and researches [electronic voting systems](https://www.cse.sc.edu/~buell/Public_Data/evoting.html).

### 215-resources
Instructor [Pat O'Keefe](https://cse.sc.edu/~pokeefe/unix-linux/)
teaches CSCE 215, an introductory Unix/Linux course at the University of
South Carolina. I have the pleasure of being his teaching assistant
for the 2018 Spring semester.

## My works

### Dotfiles
I stole this idea shamelessly from
[Charles Daniels](https://github.com/charlesdaniels/dotfiles).
Check out his stuff, it's pretty cool

### Notes
Various things I found around the web

### Resources.txt
Various useful links I've found around the web

### Template.makefile
Boilerplate for new projects, including backups and testing.
Currently supports C++ and Java, but could easily be modified
to support more languages.
